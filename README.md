## Architecture üèó

The system consists of 3 parts

 * Front-end application where snake is implemented with rust/webassembly

 * Azure functions for setting and fetching highscores from a database

 * MongoDB database

 **TODO: Update the diagram after switching DB provider**
 ![architecture diagram](./architecture.svg)

We use a serverless approach, where the majority of the code is front-end.

## Development üê≥

Run all services with docker compose:

```console
docker-compose up -d --build
```

Then open front-end at [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

To stop all services and remove their containers:

```console
docker-compose down
```

### Required Tools

[docker](https://www.docker.com/) and docker-compose (incuded in Docker Desktop)
